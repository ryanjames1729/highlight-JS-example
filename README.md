# highlight-JS-example
This is just a simple HTML page to demonstrate how the highlightJS framework can be implemented to show your code.
I'm also using the CSS file for 'atom-one-dark' to get the dark background for the code.

HighlightJS can be found at: https://highlightjs.org/ and the atom-one-dark file can be found at: https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/styles/atom-one-dark.css

To view the HTML I set up, go here: https://ryanjames1729.github.io/highlight-JS-example
